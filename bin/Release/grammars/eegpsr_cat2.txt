/********************************************************************
*
* FORMAT
*
*********************************************************************
*
* FILE HEADER
* ===========================
* A grammar file must start with the grammar name and tier in the
* following format:
*
* ; grammar name MyGrammar
* ; grammar tier High
*
* Accepted values for the tier are Easy, Moderate, and High.
*
* After defining the grammar's name and tier, other grammar files
* can be imported with the following directives:
*
* ; load   path/to/grammar/file.txt
* ; import path/to/grammar/file.txt
* ; import path/to/grammar/file.txt as $nonterminal
*
* The first directive loads all the non-terminals in the referred
* grammar file as if they were explicitly in the file being loaded
* with the same effect of concatenating both files. The second
* directive acts like the first one but skipping the $Main non-
* terminal of the second grammar, making non-terminals available for
* re-use, but not being attached to the production graph. In
* contrast the third directive makes accessible only the $Main rule
* of the imported grammar via $nonterminal (other imported rules are
* internally renamed).
*
*
* Remarks:
*     - $nonterminal can be any valid non-terminal.
*     - The path to the grammar file may be enclosed within double
*       quotes and be a relative path. If the file cannot be found,
*       a {void} wildcard (see below) will be used, specifying the
*       nature of the error as meta-data.
*
*
*
* ROOT
* ===========================
* The root rule S of the grammar is the $Main Non-Terminal. In
* order for the grammar to be valid, it must contain at least
* one $Main rule.
*
*
*
* Non-Terminal identifiers
* ===========================
* A valid Non-Terminal identifier is a sequence of one or more
* letters, digits, or underscore characters (_). Spaces, punctuation
* marks, and symbols cannot be part of a Non-Terminal identifier.
*
*
*
* Wildcards
* ===========================
* Wilcards are strings within braces which are used during random
* sentence generation, replacing them by random values. The same
* random value may be specified for a set of wildcards by specifying
* an ID. Also, the type may be optionally specified. Syntax is as
* follows:
*
*	{wildcard [type] [id] [where condition] [meta:[metadata]]}
*
* When the "where" literal string is found within a wildcard, the
* condition following it is evaluated while looking for replacements
* (see Filtering Results).
*
* When the "meta:" literal string is found within a wildcard, all
* text following it is addressed as metadata. While metadata is not
* part of the generated sentence, it can be used to display
* additional information.
*
* The following wildcards are defined:
*	{category}	An object category.
*				Types are ignored.
*	{gesture}	A gesture name.
*				Types are ignored.
*	{location}	Any location.
*				Types may be [room|placement|beacon]
*	{name}		A person name.
*				Types may be [male|female]
*	{object}	An object name.
*				Types may be [known|alike]
*	{question}	The "question" literal string.
*				Types are ignored. Metadata contains a question/answer
*				from the predefined questions set.
*	{void}		Void construct used to inject metadata.
*
*				Types are ignored.
*
*
* Also, the following alias are defined:
*
*	{beacon}	Alias for {location beacon}
*	{aobject}	Alias for {object alike}
*	{female}	Alias for {name female}
*	{kobject}	Alias for {object known}
*	{male}		Alias for {name male}
* 	{placement}	Alias for {location placement}
*	{room}		Alias for {location room}
*   {sobject}	Alias for {object special}
*
*
*
* Filtering results
* ---------------------------
* Replacements can be filtered by adding conditions after the
* "where" literal string. Such replacements must target an specific
* property of the type used for wildcard replacement. For instance,
* consider the following examples:
*
*	{kobject where Category="Food"}
*	{object where Category="Food" and Type="Known"}
*
* Both wildcards are equivalent and will be replaced by a random
* known object from the Food category, if there is such category.
* Conditions support wildcard nesting, for which the following
* example is also valid.
*
*	$Main = {object where Category="{category 1}""} belonds to
*	{category 1 where Name!="Cleaning Stuff"}
*
* In cases when the query returns no results, the condition can't
* be met and another rule will be attempted. This is the case when
* a property is not present, so it can't be evaluated. Exceptions to
* this rule are 1) evaluating a property against literal "null"
* (without quotes), which is evaluated as true when the property is
* absent; and 2) evaluating an inexistent property against a boolean
* (true or false), which will implicitly assume that the property exists
* and has its value set to false.
* 
*
*
*
* Obfuscating information 
* ===========================
* A wildcard ended with a question mark will be replaced by an
* obfuscated value instead of the random value choosen by that
* wildcard, which will be included as metadata. The obfuscation is
* performed as follows (wildcards not shown can not be obfuscated):
*
*	{category?}	The "objects" literal string
*	{location?}	The "room" literal string for rooms, for placements
*               and beacons, the room to which the location belongs.
*	{object?}	The category to which the object belongs.
*
*
*
* Referencing
* ===========================
*
* Pronouns
* ---------------------------
* Wildcards can be referenced with the {pron} construct.
* By default, the {pron} construct refers to the last wilcard found
* in the following order:
*
*   - {name}   wildcards
*   - {object} wildcards
*   - last wildcard found
*
* By default the {pron} construct is replaced with a Personal Pronoun
* (OBJECTIVE CASE), namely: him, her, it. Subjective cases of the
* personal pronoun (he, she, it) are also supported by setting the
* type of the {pron} construct to the `sub` value. Namely:
*
*	{pron}		Reference with pronoun, objective case.
*	{pron obj}	Reference with pronoun, objective case (explicit).
*	{pron sub}	Reference with pronoun, subjective case.
*
*
*
* Commenting
* ===========================
* C/C++/Java comments are permitted.
* In addition, any words, spaces, or marks after # or % or ;
* are ignored
*
